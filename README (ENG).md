## About the project

The development of a microcomputer based on the Zilog Z80 microprocessor is a fascinating and interesting project that allows you to immerse yourself in the world of modern electronics and programming. The Z80 microprocessor, released in 1976, is considered one of the most influential and widely used processors of its time.
A microcomputer based on the Zilog Z80 microprocessor is a computer system capable of performing various operations and tasks, including mathematical calculations, data processing and control of peripheral devices. This project will help you gain a better understanding of microprocessor architecture and operation, as well as develop skills in assembly language programming and electronic circuit design.
During the development of a microcomputer based on the Zilog Z80 microprocessor, various digital components such as memory, input-output devices, and software development will be involved to perform the desired functions. Breadboards will be used during design. Thanks to the development board platform, you can create a prototype of a microcomputer and configure it to work with various peripheral devices.
As a result of the successful development of a microcomputer based on the Z80, we will receive a functional and customizable computer system that can be used both for teaching and for implementing small projects and research.
